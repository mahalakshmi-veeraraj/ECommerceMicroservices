Category: Creational Design Pattern.
- Manages the pool of reusable objects like DBConnection object.
- Borrow from the pool -> use it -> then return it back to pool.

Advantages:
1. Reduce the overhead of creating and destroying the frequently required object (generally

2. Reduce the latency, as it uses the pre initialized object.
3. Prevent Resource exhaustion by managing the number of resource intensive object creation.

Disadvantages:
1. Resource leakage
