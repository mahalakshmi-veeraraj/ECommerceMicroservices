Category: Creational Design Pattern.
- Manages the pool of reusable objects like DBConnection object.
- Borrow from the pool -> use it -> then return it back to pool.

Advantages:
1. Reduce the overhead of creating and destroying the frequently required object (generally 
resource intensive objects).
2. Reduce the latency, as it uses the pre initialized object.
3. Prevent Resource exhaustion by managing the number of resource intensive object creation.

Disadvantages:
1. Resource leakage can happen, if object is not handled properly and not being returned to the pool properly.
2. Require more memory because of managing the pool.
3. Pool management require thread safety, which is additional overhead.
4. Adds application complexity becuase of managing the pool.
